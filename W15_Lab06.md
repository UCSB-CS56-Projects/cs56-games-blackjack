The game seems pretty well put together already. The README is clear, informative, and keeps track of past versions of the project. When compiled and run, the game starts as expected and ran smoothly for me after a few times playing. 
I see that the README has already been cleaned up and the JUnit jar file has already been moved to a folder named "lib." Also, the build.xml file has clearly been cleaned up and descriptions have been added to the targets. 
So, it appears that the best way to improve the game would be to work on a couple of the issues listed on the repo, or come up with some of my own and work on them. I think that implementing a statistics tracker and a save option to be able to reload these statistics after exiting would be additions to this game. I plan to add some instance variables to the Player.java class that will keep track of a player's wins, losses, total net gain, etc. Then, using either serialization or simply writing data to a text file, a save option can be implemented to reload these stats at a later time. If these two features turn out to be easy to implement I also plan to add the ability for a player to back out of the game between rounds, so that other players can continue to play without restarting the game entirely.
